The exploration of important themes such as religion, war, and distinct perspectives on biblical figures leads to the most immersive moments of a film that takes time to find its rhythm. With a clear vision from Wes Ball and fantastic performances, the impressive motion-capture work contributes tremendously to a visually mesmerizing experience.    For fans of the saga, it‚Äôs a continuation worth following with interest, promising more moral reflections on the evolution of nature and the inevitable cycle of life.""    Rating: B",7.0
663f418fda58cf1d0fa40f99,653346,CinemaSerf,"Quick question. So it was a virus that led to the role reversal between the speaking humans and their ape counterparts? Now the apes have the upper hand and humanity is back in the caves. What I don't really get is why everything is in ruins and why there's an escalator in the middle of a forest full of zebras? Speech is crucial for communication, granted, but as the apes now thrive amidst the ruins of human construction I couldn't quite figure out why it was all decimated in the first place. Was there a war? Did I miss it? Anyway, Simian society still claims derivation from ""Caesar"" and in typical human fashion is just as divided. The apes live a peaceful life stealing the eagle's eggs from precariously perched nests so they can rear them themselves - and the eagles don't really seem to mind. The militaristic gorillas raid their village and drag them all to the seaside resort of ""Proximus"" where he is trying to break into an human, subterranean, vault. The raid caused havoc amongst the peaceable apes and left only ""Noa"" to try to free them. En route, he encounters ""Mae"" (Freya Allan) - an human who can speak, and upon arrival she befriends another talking person ""Trevathan"" (William H. Macy) who are both expected to help reach the treasures of the vault. She knows what's in there, and with the help of her new friends hopes to salvage what she was sent to retrieve - but without allowing any weapons inside to fall into enemy hands. It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we've established who is who and the story has kicked in, it's quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn't really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.",7.0
6647b6493f44dc5e377879c9,653346,r96sk,"Has its moments, though overall I kinda found <em>'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes'</em> a bit of a slog to sit through.    The original trilogy are films that I do enjoy, they're very good. This fourth installment, however, underwhelmed me throughout its 145 minute run time. It starts off a new plot, obviously given how <em>'War for the Planet of the Apes'</em> concluded, and the new characters and their stories didn't really interest me.    Some of the action is watchable, the military bunker angle is decent, the visual effects are strong (but we already knew that) and the bits directly with Noa and Raka are the film's best in my opinion. I don't, though, really recall much else about this and remember feeling quite nonplussed whilst watching; the literal final music-filled shot got me pumped though, out of nowhere. None of the cast (voice or otherwise) stand out, either.    I'd have finished this franchise with the 2017 flick, but very much sounds like the filmmakers are planning another trilogy with this one. Hopefully I'll enjoy those (and the inevitable 2030s 'new' trilogy... üòè) more.",6.0
665ed96ce1aa8153791c31cf,653346,Midi-chlorian_Count,"Just seen this and thought it was a pretty good edition to the series.    The CGI is now good enough for what is probably our first really in-depth look at the ape civilization following the fall of man.    Sure, it doesn't have as grandiose a story as Caesar's but it does a grand job of world building and showing us how the ape society of the distant future is functioning. The exploration of the mythology which has built up with regards to their past and Caesar's time is also interesting.    Proximus isn't even really a villain as such, which makes him and his vision for the future a nice counter to the uncertain goals of Noa's human companion.    Particularly enjoyed the ending, which, when you realise it is coming, you have to laugh as it has been set up throughout the movie.    And the little kicker was good too. Setting us up nicely for a sequel which may see this reboot series veer back towards it's origins.    Definitely well worth seeing if you're a fan of the reboot series...",6.0
666191a8d49c84c638b7848d,653346,Hotplix,"""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"" is a thrilling continuation of the acclaimed franchise, directed by Wes Ball. The film dives deeper into the evolving society of intelligent apes, showcasing stunning visual effects and a compelling narrative that explores themes of leadership, conflict, and coexistence. The performances, particularly by Andy Serkis as Caesar, are powerful and emotive, bringing depth to the characters and the story.

6662b56f752063ec0ee97ce4,573435,CinemaSerf,"I'd completely forgotten about ""Bad Boys for Life"" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that ""Mike"" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - ""Armando"" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner ""Marcus"" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, ""Mike"" has just got married; ""Marcus"" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved ""Capt. Howard"" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of ""Mike"" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. ""Howard"" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated ""Armando"" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",7.0
6661353b8345e2cf91adcd34,1001311,MovieGuys,"Under Paris is rather ridiculous French Jaws wannabe.     Whilst this production is loaded down with the predictable woke tropes I've come to expect from Netflix productions, what really caught my attention was how idiotically implausible the story is.     In the opening scene a group of male divers is tasked with investigating predation at a oceanic rubbish site, that's ensnared dolphins and other dead, sea life.  Sharks soon turn up leading to the presence of a  female shark, the scientific group have been monitoring.Inexplicably the shark has essentially doubled in size, leading their all knowing female boss to ask the divers to take ""a sample"" from the monster for study, rather than following the sane and reasonable path of fleeing in terror. Predictably, the shark doesn't take this treatment too well and eats the divers. At this point our intrepid female lead having just witnessed the horrific attacks on her research ships monitors, dives into the water, to confront the monster with a spear gun, that would hardly scare a large Tuna.     Without spoiling things for those who want to watch this, it doesn't get any better from here on in. Really if you are going to make a film of this kind, is it truly that hard to make it, at least, a little believable?     The acting is alright, as are the action sequences but the sense of ""terror"" found in Jaws is largely absent. The key ingredient that drives, what is essentially a monster movie, forward.     In summary, sinks beneath its own unbelievable story and  bland exposition. If you really want a oceanic monster film, try Jaws instead.",5.0

660e8ae9149565017dbd77e1,823464,CinemaSerf,"It has to get at least three stars because it's got Dan Stevens (and his piercing eyes) in it. Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with ""Kong"" ruling the roost deep in ""Hollow Earth""; ""Godzilla"" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and ""Ilene"" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled ""Jia"" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for ""Monarch"" and mankind. ""Kong"" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, ""Trapper"" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. ""Godzilla"" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by ""Kong"" and his human pals. With ""Bernie"" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why ""Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times ""Kong"" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from ""Jurassic Park"" to episodes of ""Stargate"". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth.",6.0
66186e3cbbcae0017c949ee9,823464,r96sk,"A whole load of nothing!    <em>'Godzilla √ó Kong: The New Empire'</em> is not a good movie, in my opinion anyway. It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.    The needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.    The whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.    Cast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.    My review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.    Catching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that.

664289f8d9f11056b45f1de0,823464,MovieGuys,"Godzilla x Kong is an exposition driven production, wrapped up in CGI eye candy, in an attempt to make the generally bland proposition, marginally appetising to the end consumer.     The eye candy aspect of this monster action flick is well done. In fact, its flawless and whilst this might evoke ""ooohs and ahhhs"", on the big screen, there's a lot more to any film, than visuals.     Unlike Godzilla minus One, this Hollywood affair fails to deliver beyond the superficial. Its back story, sprinkled with the usual woke fluff, is formulaic, unimaginative and frankly, a little lazy.     The results a film whose elaborate exposition, holds you, for a time but equally, its effect quickly dissipates. A little over half way in, I became thoroughly bored and distracted.

664ae0c964e340818f795498,823464,Sejian,"It took me two attempts to get into Godzilla x Kong. The first 25 minutes of this movie are utterly boring. I've got no problem with human drama in movies like this when it's done right, or at least engaging. Monarch was engaging. For the main human characters here, this only ever gets engaging at the very end.    I'm beginning to think the problem here is that movies like this are no longer ""movies"", they're ""installments"". They don't feel like self-contained polished products anymore, they feel like filler episodes filled with smaller barely connected filler episodes. Godzilla x Kong is like the opening to Age of Ultron, except it's the majority of the movie. You just don't really feel grounded at all.    There's too much music. They try to recapture the ""magic"" of the intro and ending of Godzilla vs Kong but it fails spectacularly. It was cute there because the focus was on Kong and they didn't overdo it. Here the focus is on Trapper AKA NOT Kong AKA no one cares about Trapper because not giving the man a name is doing a stupid.    The monster action is fine. Kong meeting the other Great Apes got me pumped and the finale is lackluster but satisfying enough.    So, Season 2 of Monarch when?",6.0

The visual effects were passable enough and I did like the continued characterization given to Kong and to some extent, Godzilla.

It is paced absolutely spot on, the end comes around so quick; probably because I was hooked. The cast do great jobs.

661a45ac5ff34e014958b3c5,929590,CinemaSerf,"Nope, sorry, this just didn't work for me. It appears that there is a civil war amongst these United States. California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist ""Lee"" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort ""Joel"" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate ""Sammy"" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer ""Jessie"" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his ""always take fuel when you can"" or ""this way only leads to death"" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue ""Press"" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it's supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of ""Falling Skies"" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience? I'm not one of them and this didn't.",6.0
661c0d40cb5c8e0186759569,929590,Brent Marchant,"Cautionary tales often have some of the most significant impact when brought to life on the big screen, and that‚Äôs certainly the case with the latest offering from writer-director Alex Garland. The filmmaker‚Äôs gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, ‚ÄúCivil War‚Äù provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what‚Äôs left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists‚Äô journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn‚Äôt provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won‚Äôt matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that‚Äôs important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to ‚Äúget the story,‚Äù no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture‚Äôs message is one of grave importance, especially in today‚Äôs trying, polarized climate. We‚Äôd be wise to pay attention to what‚Äôs being said in this important work, handily the best ‚Äì and most troubling ‚Äì release of 2024 thus far.",8.0
663022be4d67910124babf0a,929590,edrddz,"The film, although set in a context of armed conflict, deviates from the traditional war theme to focus on war photojournalists, promoting a perspective on the work of such professionals. Through a series of small scenes, the director seeks to compose a portrait of these professionals' actions on the battlefield without declaring the reasons for the war or identifying the sides involved.    Each scene, individually, is well-executed, standing out for the quality of cinematography and an immersive sound work that amplifies the tension. However, these scenes, although effective individually, fail to come together cohesively. The result is a film that seems less than the sum of its parts.

Perhaps this is a reaction to the climate of division and fear that exists in the USA today? That said, why make a film about something contentious, if you have nothing contentious to say?

I like how the characters work and how their world is set up, conceptually it works very nicely but visually I don't love it - something about the way it looks is kinda plain to me. While Joy & Co. are memorable, the voices behind them aren't all that standout in my opinion.    Phyllis Smith is my pick of the cast, she is the perfect person to play the character Sadness. Amy Poehler (Joy) and Lewis Black (Anger) are more than satisfactory, too.    It has a good message and meaning, for me it's just missing something extra. Still enjoyed it though.",7.0

This is a wonderfully little story of world building and exploration of the human mind through a young teen girl who is scare of the huge amount of change happening in her life.  The parallel of internal struggle and outward reaction to adversity really sets this movie apart.    The audience is literally taken on a exploration of the mind, and the story is not only fun, but capable of serious philosophical concepts.  Because it exemplifies ""show, don't tell"" those conversations are compacted into palatable actions by the characters.    This is a movie that might make you laugh, cry or both.

6469d51c2bcf670172b1b1c0,150540,CinemaSerf,"""Riley"" is a pleasant little girl living with her parents in Minnesota where she plays ice hockey, has loads of friends and generally, all in her garden is rosey. Her parents decide they need to move to (a rather drab) house in San Francisco, though, and as you might expect this causes some new tensions, especially as their furniture seems to have been lost in transit! Inside her pretty little head, we see her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness personified and vying for control of her personality during this lively time. Joy seems most adept at managing the situation and keeping things on an even keel, but after an inadvertent intervention from sadness, the two find themselves expelled from the control room and having to make their way back from deep within her memories before it all comes crashing down at the hands of those less optimistic sensations left in charge! It's almost as if there is an ""X-Factor"" judging panel inside everyone's head making decisions and discussing with each other which of their traits ought to prevail as circumstances dictate - and in the main it works well. It ultimately serves to advise that none of these emotions can exist in isolation and that we must learn to take the rough with the smooth, the good with the not so good. The animation is entertaining, some humour amongst the more thought-provoking stuff; a proper ""train of thought"" and a childhood friend ""Bing Bong"" whose role in her life is fading as she grows up. I loved the ending - not least because any sequel would have to deal with the big red ""puberty"" button on their console and a lot of mischief could be had here.",7.0

Richard Linklater and Glen Powell deliver an insanely hilarious, genuinely entertaining script elevated by the filmmaker's flawless technical execution and career-best performances from Powell and Adria Arjona.

6656f0ea86cc2b72df1cf0b1,974635,CinemaSerf,"At this rate, Glen Powell is going to be able to pay Tom Cruise back for his flying lessons pretty swiftly! Here, he's a rather geeky teacher (Gary) who teaches philosophy at a college whilst occasionally helping out the cops with some criminal profiling. When one of their investigators ""Jasper"" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con. The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities. It's ""Maddy"" (Adria Arjona) who sets the cat amongst the pigeons when she asks him to get shot of her thuggish husband ""Ray"" (Evan Holtzman). He takes a shine to her and talks her out of her criminal ploy. Quickly the two are seeing each other - which is manna from heaven for the deposed ""Jasper"". When her husband is found dead, he thinks he knows exactly who did what and how best to exact his revenge... It's quite an entertaining romantic thriller this, providing Powell with an opportunity to charm his way through an almost two hours of cinema that is light and fluffy, completely preposterous yet based on a true character. Arjona looks like she is having a good time here, too - and the last twenty minutes are quite fun. No, it won't trouble a BAFTA jury I suspect - but it's quite enjoyable summertime fayre.",7.0

This movie is paced very well, the two hour run time did not feel of that length at all.

Needless to say the gang are a politically correct assemblage that tick just about every box and are frankly all pretty well deserving of what's to come. On that front, the clue's in the title. Exploring the house looking to top up their supply of booze, they find a locked room full of all things occult and that includes an unique set of tarot cards. Rather foolishly, but typically disparagingly, they demand that ""Haley"" (Harriet Slater) read their fortunes. Next thing they are dropping like flies - all in a manner they gradually realise is akin to the results of the tarot reading. As they gruesomely dwindle, they realise that they are going to need some help and so thanks to Google spook, they find a woman (Olwen Fou√©r√©) who informs them of the bleak history of their toxic tarot and tells them that the cards' destruction might be their only road to salvation. Thing is, can they survive long enough to get back to the house? There's nothing at all original here, sorry. We've seen it loads of times before and the uninteresting dynamic between the characters is even more predictable than the denouement. To be fair, the candle-lit visual effects are quite effective at times, but the acting is pretty dreadful and the whole frat-like presentation left me looking at the clock after half an hour.

""Colt"" (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for the all action hero ""Tom Ryder"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whilst sort of dating aspiring director ""Jody"" (Emily Blunt). An accident on set drives ""Colt"" away from the business altogether until a random call from producer ""Gail"" (Hannah Waddingham) informs him that ""Jody"" is to direct her first film in Australia and he has been especially requested! Of course he hadn't, and when he turns up - much to the surprise of the production, they sort of settle for a truce as he gets back into the swing of rolling cars and jumping from burning wreckage. Where's the star though? Well it transpires that's what ""Gail"" has really brought him to establish. He's gone AWOL. Not for the first time, ""Ryder"" is a bit flaky - but all ""Colt"" need do is track down their wayward pretty boy and then he can escape this embarrassing scenario and go back home. Needless to say, his investigations soon immerse him in a dangerous world of drugs, unicorns and even more car chasing and pyrotechnics. Can he find his charge and maybe even restore his romance? There's precisely no jeopardy with any of that, even if there is quite a daft twist in the tale at the end, but that doesn't matter. This is an excuse for some good looking people to have fun celebrating the life of the movie stuntman. It's good fun to watch with Gosling oozing charisma as we go along on a trip that reveals just a little of the smoke and mirrors that is routinely used to convince us that what we see on screen is real - and that nobody usually dies! Sydney harbour is used to good effect, though I maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the general manager of the opera house when their film crew turned up, and the dialogue is quite a witty mix of hackneyed metaphor, old lines from famous movies and plenty of corn and cheese. ATJ doesn't really feature so much, but when he does he's clearly taking a pop at all things vain and superficial about the cult of image, and Blunt looks like she is enjoying herself as she tries to get her film in the can despite her missing frontman, the wrong kind of sand on the beach and her clearly having the hots for her ex. A good soundtrack helps it all along and though I doubt I'll recall much about this in three months, it's a lively poke at the characters that make movies and I quite enjoyed it.",7.0
5e2099dc0102c900163d1076,38700,Manuel S√£o Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @  https://www.msbreviews.com    I was never a big fan of the Bad Boys films. Firstly, I'm not too fond of Michael Bay as a director (as a producer, he's fine). The way he directs his action sequences is incredibly choppy, filled with questionable CGI, very hard to follow, and we all know his passion for exploding everything. Oh, and I can't forget about the constant product placement (amazing how in a brutal explosion, everything is destroyed except a gorgeous-looking Audi car that remains intact). Secondly, the storytelling always felt extremely generic and unsurprising. So, obviously, my expectations weren't very high‚Ä¶    Maybe that's why I enjoyed Bad Boys For Life way more than I anticipated. This movie should be a lesson to the Fast and Furious franchise. To make a mindless entertaining action flick, the lighthearted tone has to be well-established from the get-go. Despite the fact that the third act deals with absurd emotional twists worthy of a Mexican soap opera, the screenwriters are able to find just the right amount of harmless fun. I didn't watch a single clip before the film, and ten minutes in, I acknowledged that its goal was to simply be entertaining without taking itself too seriously.    Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah balance the more dramatic family issues with the ludicrous action very well. The latter sequences are much better than Bay's. The car chases, even when containing a few too many cuts, are relatively easy to follow, and they pack that necessary adrenaline rush. There are a few surprising shootouts that are filmed to make them look like one take, which definitely brings something pretty uncommon to this kind of formulaic action movies. Technically, I think both directors did an excellent job, especially considering that this was their debut feature film.    However, the story brings everything down. I believe Mexican soap operas might have better scripts. The dialogue reaches such a cringe-worthy level. Every essential plot information is given either through lazy character interactions or by that magical computer that every generic action movie possesses with which the main characters can basically know everything about everyone at the click of a few buttons. The comedy is quite hit-and-miss to me, a lot of the jokes didn't land, but some did make me chuckle. Overall, the screenplay is as cliche as it could be, and that last shot‚Ä¶ I hate it. In the end, it's the cast who saves the boring narrative.    Will Smith and Martin Lawrence share fantastic chemistry, and their banter is always entertaining to watch, even if it isn't as hilarious as it could be. I liked Lawrence more than Smith, maybe due to the non-action, family comedy bits that worked seamlessly. Nevertheless, it's dumb fun, and it's plainly visible that the actors had a blast shooting this movie. The whole cast transfer the joy that they had on set to the screen, and it's pretty noticeable. Watching Alexander Ludwig (Dorn) outside Vikings is always a pleasure (I so wish that he gets more important roles in the future), and the whole AMMO team (Vannesa Hudgens, Charles Melton, Paola Nunez) is all compelling enough, even if the characters are two-dimensional.    It's simple: whether you enjoy the Bad Boys saga or not, this is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it. It's a pure popcorn-entertainment action flick with recognizable actors who all share great chemistry. With Michael Bay out of the director helm, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah deliver surprisingly good action sequences, considering this is their debut feature film. The formulaic, cliche, soap opera story is straight-up ridiculous at some points, and it carries such an aura of predictability that when it tries to introduce an emotional twist, it merely becomes absurd. The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole ""Bad Boys one last time"" tagline‚Ä¶ I'm extremely undecided on which side this review should fall, so I'll base my decision on the answer to the following question: ""Am I going to (want to) see this movie again or another sequel?"" Honestly‚Ä¶ no.    Rating: C+",5.0

This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The ""Immortan Joe"" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the ""Guardian of Gastown"" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the ""Bullet Farm"" - a quarry. They have a loose bartering arrangement that allows each to hold their own territory and this is arrangement ""Dementus"" and his army of thousands wants to take control of. He does manage to secure a better deal with ""Joe"" but only if he trades his ""Little D"" as part of the bargain. Once she's been duly swapped and introduced to his harem, she determines that she needs a new ID! Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver ""Praeteorian Jack"" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of ""Smeg"", ""Rictus Erectus"" and ""Scrotus"" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2¬Ω hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",7.0

On the upside is loads of heart stopping action, amazing cinematic's, great sets, plus strong performances from the cast.    A lesser aspect of the downside is the unnecessarily drawn out back story, replete with details about the key character, no one cares about, which, in turn, leads to the main fault in this film.......ITS NOT ABOUT MAD MAX Rockatansky.    Lets be honest, no one's really interested in peripheral characters or their back story, they want the REAL DEAL. That's where this film was always going to fall flat with viewing audiences.    If this film had been about Mad Max with a back story covering as yet unrevealed aspects of the life of  the younger and older Max, in the latter case played by the actor who made the franchise famous, Mel Gibson, then I suspect Hollywood would have a real HIT on their hands.

Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.    Anya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.    Visually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch.

Debutant filmmaker Arkasha Stevenson clearly leaves her mark on a technically sublime film that easily becomes the best installment of the franchise after the original movie.    Lead yourself into temptation and embrace the incarnated evil. You won't regret it.""    Rating: B-",6.0
661696f6dc1cb401631bcbdb,437342,CinemaSerf,"Novice ""Margaret"" (Nell Tiger Free) arrives in Rome to a welcome from her cardinal sponsor ""Lawrence"" (Bill Nighy) where she hopes to complete taking her vows. She is greeted with open arms and taken on a tour of what she hopes will become her new home. This is when she encounters the shy ""Carlita"" (Nicole Sorace) who spends much of her time in solitude drawing. This intrigues ""Margaret"" but not as much as some of the other goings on in the maternity ward of the hospital. Her concerns are only exacerbated by a meeting with ""Fr. Brennan"" (Ralph Ineson) who spins her an horrific yarn that makes her head spin and sets her on a detection task that reveals a conspiracy to end all conspiracies - one that is conceived by the church for it's own perpetuation, but that could bring down both it and mankind. At times it's quite a decently paced watch, this, with a little gruesomeness (isn't it odd that the tools of medicine so often look like those of torture?) but given we have known the denouement since 1976 the lack of any real jeopardy does rather rob the film of much of a sense of menace and what ""jump moments"" there are are all a bit predictable. Free does try to imbue her character with a bit of passion, and she manages along well enough but Nighy is weak and the single appearance from Charles Dance adds nothing at all to these lacklustre proceedings. Prequels are always hard to deliver. This tries, but sadly we've seen it all before and I fear the nun theme is beginning to self-flagellate itself to death. A short story over-stretched.",6.0
665f880bc25540e1b0090510,437342,MovieGuys,"The First Omen, like so many latter day spin offs, of well respected franchises, fails to understand what made the original films so successful.     I well remember the original Omen film and how it held me. Its intricate story, which chillingly displaced a sense of normalcy with a ever growing  horror and otherworldly menace, was truly compelling.     By contrast. The First Omen lacks true progression and originality. For well over half the film, it is, in fact, rather dull. It does make vain attempts to utilises tropes and events of the earlier films but fails to develop a measurably meaningful, original narrative, to accompany them. Moreover, as other reviewers have stated, quite correctly, in my view, its safe ending does little to mitigate the overriding sense of cinematic malaise.    In summary, if you have never experienced the Omen franchise, don't start with this film. The original films are horror masterpieces, well worth your time. By contrast, this film will, I suspect, be remembered as a minor footnote with Omen fans, like myself and that's if its lucky.",6.0
